  <p>This course will look across different inquiry paradigms for
  human-centered computing research. Through readings and discussions
  of both theoretical and in-practice considerations, we will explore
  what it means <i>to know</i> through the lens of positivism,
  interpretivism, critical theory, and research through design. </p>

  <p>Students will gain experience in reading research papers from fields
  outside of computer science, and in relating those papers to what we
  do as technologists. The course will also introduce the concept of
  reflective writing to enable self-awareness of learning and
  insights. </p>

  <p>The learning objectives for the course are:
  <ul>
    <li>High-level understanding of major paradigms in human-centered
    computing research
    <ul>
    <li>Positivism (and post-positivism)
     <li>Interpretivism
     <li>Critical theory
      <li>Research through design
      </ul>
     <li>Ability to classify research reports into a major paradigm(s)
     <li>Ability to critique research from a paradigm perspective
     <li>Ability to think and write reflectively
     <li>Experience with giving and receiving critical feedback on
  research writing
    </ul>
  </p>

	<td class="data"><p>In the first half of course we will read
    theoretical papers about each of the four paradigms, along with
    examples of the paradigm in practice. This is
    intended to give you a flavor for what each paradigm values and
    its historical context, but these will (necessarily) be shallow
    overviews. There is required reading for each class, along with
    supplemental reading if you want to dig deeper -- you should come
    to each class ready to discuss the readings. We will spend the
    last 15 minutes of each class doing <i>reflexive</i> writing to
    help you digest the discussions, as well as to leave a trace for
    you to reflect on your learning and thinking through the course. 
	  </p>

	  <p>In the second half of course you will develop a critical
	  argument about some aspect of your field from one
	  of the paradigms. The idea is to apply what you are learning
	  to your own research endeavours. This will be a very
	  open-ended writing project, but it will require finding
	  examples of research reports in your own area and further
	  reading in your choose paradigm. The end result will be a
	  position or theoretical short paper that focuses on a
	  quality argument and good citations. As a class we will rely
	  on each other for input: everyone will pitch three project
	  ideas to the class for feedback, along with 2-cycles of
	  in-class workshopping of drafts. Ideally your project can be
	  the start of a research paper, or be part of a project you
	  are currently working on.

<p><strong>Students with disabilities&nbsp;</strong>The University of

<p><strong>Addressing sexual misconduct</strong>&nbsp;Title IX makes
it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender (which
includes sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) is a civil
rights offense subject to the same kinds of accountability and the
same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected
categories such as race, national origin, color, religion, age, status
as a person with a disability, veteran&rsquo;s status or genetic
information. If you or someone you know has been harassed or
assaulted, you are encouraged to report it to the Title IX Coordinator
in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 135 Park
Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 270
Union Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential
consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB,

rosters are provided to me by the Registrar's Office with students'
legal names as well as &ldquo;Preferred first names&rdquo; (if
previously entered by you in the Student Profile section of your CIS
account). Please advise me of any name or pronoun changes (and update
