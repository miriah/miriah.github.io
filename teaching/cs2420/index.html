  <p>This course provides an introduction to tools found throughout
  computer science - basic algorithms and data structures that lend
  themselves naturally to computational problem solving, and engineering computational efficiency into
  programs. Students will gain an understanding of classical
  algorithms (including sorting, searching, tree and graph traversal)
  and data structures (including linked-lists, trees, graphs, hash
  tables, and heaps). Students will complete extensive programming assignments
  that require the implementation and testing of these concepts.  </p>

	  The following are the expected outcomes for students completing this course:
	  <ul>
	    <li> Students will learn algorithms for basic searching
    and sorting, as well as the
    asymptotic behavior of each.
	    <li>Students will become proficient implementing and using
        basic data structures fundamental to computer
    science including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs,
    trees, binary search trees, Huffman trees, hash tables, binary
    heaps, and priority queues. Students will reason about the
    asymptotic behavior of basic operations on these data structures.
	    <li>Students will regularly evaluate their solutions for
    efficiency through written reports. Evaluations will summarize
    efficiency in time (Big-O and/or actual running time), efficiency
    in space (memory requirements), and/or programmer efficiency
    (ease of implementation and maintenance) of solutions.
	    <li>Students will improve on the object-oriented
    programming skills learned in CS 1410. Student understanding of
    the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and generic programming
    will be strengthened significantly by creating solutions with
    multiple levels of inheritance and by implementing generic
    versions of data structures.
	    <li>Students will gain experience using and implementing
    recursion. Students will also be introduced to dynamic
    programming. Students will learn when to apply iteration or
    dynamic programming instead of recursion.
	    <li>Students will methodically test their solutions
    according to a variety of testing models including white-box
    testing, black-box testing, and unit tests.
	    <li>Students will gain experience designing, implementing,
    and testing solutions in pairs using the techniques of pair
    programming.

	   <li> 50% assignments
	   <li> 40% exams (2)
	   <li> 10% participation and labs
	 </ul>
	 </p>
	 
	 <p> Assignments consist of weekly programming assignments,
	 some of which will be done in pairs. The specifications of
	 these assignments will be posted online each week. The
	 assignments will be due a week + a day after they are
	 released, with the exception of the second and final assignments which
	 will be due two weeks after release. <b>ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT
	 BE ACCEPTED AFTER THE DEADLINE. NO EXCEPTIONS.</b>

	 <p>You will hand in your programs
	 through the course <a class="nav"
  href="https://utah.instructure.com/courses/476999">
	 Canvas page</a>. Partial credit may be given for incorrect
	 programs, but it must be clear that a strong attempt was
	 made. If your program does not compile or run, no credit will
	 be given. Programs will be graded on readability, comments,
	 and design of the code, as well as correctness in
	 execution. Assignments will also consist of a written portion
	 describing the design of the program, and documenting the
	 performance of your code. All reports must be typed - no
	 scanned handwritten work will be accepted. If you wish
	 to appeal a score on an assignment (or a test) must do so
	 within one week of receiving the score and use the <a class="nav"

	 request form</a> posted on the class website.</p>  

	 <p> The last assignment of the semester will be a
	  comprehensive project lasting two weeks, in which you will
	  design a solution to a problem from the ground up, with
	  little or no framework given to you. You will have the
	  freedom of selecting which algorithms and data structures
	  are best suited to solving the problem, and designing a
	  complete program around your solution. </p> 
	  
	  <p> <b>Two exams will be given</b> - one during the regular class
	  time, and one during finals week. The in class exam will
	  take place on <b>Thursday, February 22nd</b>, an the final exam will take
	  place on <b>Monday, April 30th from 3:30-5:30pm</b>. All exams are written exams. As an
	  anti-cheating measure, students who fail the exams will fail
	  the class regardless of their assignment scores. </p> 

	  <p> The class participation grade will be based on
	  completion of lab exercises and
	  overall contribution to the 
	  class and labs. </p>

	  <p> The final grade will be calculated from exams,
	  programming assignments, written homework, and laboratory
	  exercises. A's will be given to students within 90%, B's
	  within 80%, C's within 70% etc. We do, however, reserve the
