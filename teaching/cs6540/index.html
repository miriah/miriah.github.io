  <p>This course provides an introduction to several major areas of
  research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It is based in a
  combination of readings and discussion that span HCI research
  contributions, methods, and focus areas. The course readings will require preparing reports on a combination of
  historic framing papers and more current results. This will help you
  examine what the HCI community considers a meaningful contribution
  across a variety of problems, thus helping prepare you to understand
  and make meaningful contributions in these and other areas of
  HCI. Coursework will include short written discussion of the
  readings, a final project, a take-home exam, and a short stats exercise
  The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI,
  while 
  remaining open to different possibilities. You might choose to
  design and implement a new piece of HCI technology, or you might
  choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with
  HCI research implications. We will emphasize open discussion and
  feedback in all aspects of the course. </p>

	  <p>
	  Assigned readings will focus on research topics, generally consisting of:
	  <ul> 
	    <li> A historic framing paper: presenting a theory,
	  language, or understanding that can help in understanding
	  and contextualizing the contributions of additional
	    research.
	    <li> Two papers that provide more recent or specific
	  contributions: presenting the type of contribution you might
	    initially be expected to attempt in your research.
	    </ul> </p>
<p>
You are expected to read: (1) the historical framing paper, and (2)
	    either of the more current papers (in other words,
	    whichever seems more compelling or interesting to
	    you). You obviously may choose to read all three. The
	    lectures will link to the assigned readings on Canvas and provide any
	    day-specific revisions to this reading structure. </p>
<p>
You are expected to have read and considered the assigned readings
	    prior to class, as the in-class discussions are a critical
	    component of this course. </p>

<p><b>Written Discussions</b><br/>
    To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we
	    require short, written discussions of the readings. These
    discussions are expected to be 200-350 words (2-4 paragraphs)
    depending on the length and complexity of the readings. This is
    only a guideline, it is neither a necessary nor sufficient
    condition.  

	    <p> Your discussion should <b>not</b> be a summary of the
	    reading. Instead, you should focus on the following four
	    points, with a section header for each point:
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Most important point as related to HCI:</b> What
	    is the single most salient point made in the readings as
	    they relate to the broader field of HCI?
	    Justify your answer by explaining why you think the point
	    you describe is significant and the criteria you are using
	    for significance. Your answer should reflect your own
	    analysis of the topic, rather than just restating the
	      authors' claims of significance.
	      <li> <b>Other key points:</b> What are the other key
	    points of the readings? Why are they significant? Which of
	    these points were most surprising to you? Emphasize key
	    points rather than just summarizing the readings as it
	    appears in the text. This information should be written in
	    your own words and express your own understanding of the
	    material. It should not be a paraphrase of the readings and
	    should not include exact text from the readings or from
	    other sources without appropriate citations. Limit your
	    answer to no more than five other key points.  
	      <li> <b>Particularly compelling points:</b> What aspects
	      of this work were particularly well done or effective?
	      <li> <b>Unanswered or confusing:</b> What questions were
	    left unanswered by the readings? What parts of the
	      readings were hopelessly confusing?
	      </ul>

	    <p>
	   The discussions are due no later than 9:00am on the date in
	   which a reading is to be discussed. Discussions
	   turned in after the deadline will not be graded,
	   except for compelling reasons. You will turn in your
	   discussion in PDF format using Canvas -- a link will be
	   posted in the lectures along with the readings.
	    </p>


	    
<b>Grading</b><br/>
	    We will coursely grade your discussions on a scale from 0 to 3.
	    <ul>
	      <li>0: If you do not participate.
	      <li>1: If your participation seems weak and does not
	    convince us you read, understood, and considered the
	    readings. 
	      <li>2: If your participation shows you read and
	    understood the readings and had something interesting to
	    say. This will be the most common grade. 
	      <li>3: Reserved for especially insightful participation.
	    </ul>

	  <p>A course project will be a major component of your
	  work. This will require hands-on experience with HCI, while
	  remaining open to different possibilities.</p> 

	  <p>Because you are still new to HCI research, we do not
	  necessarily expect you to produce publishable work. Instead,
	  the expectation is that you will do something
	  interesting. It is then up to you to define interesting
	  according to what you want to accomplish in this project,
	  seeking appropriate feedback from the teaching staff. For example, you
	  might choose to:</p> 
	  <ul>
	    <li>Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.
	    <li>Design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.
	    <li>Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.
	    <li>Replicate an existing study or technology.
	    <li>Execute a sufficiently interesting design problem
	  (i.e., focusing on design without regard to research
	    novelty).
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>We expect most students will do projects in groups of
	  two. We will very strongly
	  discourage individuals. Working in groups is a necessary
	  part of doing research, and also important for the logistics
	  of this course.</p> 
	  </p>

	   <b>Early Feedback</b><br/>
	  <p>Course staff will be available to meet and provide early
	  feedback on Tuesday Sept 5th and Thursday Sept 7th. Meeting is
	  optional. <a class="nav"
	  href="https://doodle.com/poll/atx97p9k9dtuatz7">Sign up for 
	  the reserved meeting times.</a></p>


	  <b>Project Deliverables</b><br/>
	  <p>Project deliverables are defined in terms of a proposal,
	  a pair of self-defined milestones, and a final report. These
	  are due:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Proposal: Tuesday, Sept 26, 2017
	    <li>Milestone: Sunday, Nov 5, 2017
	    <li>Milestone: Sunday, Dec 3, 2017
	    <li> Final Report: Monday, Dec 11, 2017
	  </ul>

	  <b>Proposal</b><br/>
	  <p>Your proposal will define your initial plan for this
	  project. You can and should update this plan based on
	  feedback, progress, and findings. But the proposal needs to
	  demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project.</p> 

	  <p>You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project
	  with your research goals outside this course. However, it is
	  critical to define what you will specifically accomplish in
	  the course project. The course project must stand on its
	  own.</p> 

	  <p>Proposals consist of a short document and a short
	  in-class presentation.</p>

	  <p><i>Document:</i> Prepare a 1-page document addressing the
	  following points:</p> 

	  <ul>
	    <li><i>What makes the project interesting?</i> What is the
	    problem or research question? What is the pain-point you
	    want to solve, the new capability you want to enable, or
	    the research you want to explore?  

	    <li><i>What existing understanding of the problem has been
	    developed?</i> For a research proposal, this will briefly
	    cover the most important related work in the space you are
	    exploring. For a design proposal, this will introduce
	    existing solutions, why they fall short, and the potential
	    opportunity. 

	    <li><i>What milestones will the group plan to
	    accomplish?</i> There are two milestone reports in the
	    semester, one early and one late. These are opportunities
	    for feedback and guidance from staff and
	    classmates. Explain what your group will plan to accomplish
	    by each of these milestones. You will be asked to revisit
	    these plans during those milestone reports. 

	    <li><i>What might the group explicitly decide to omit?</i>
	    Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish
	    everything. Explain what aspects of the project you might
	    choose to ignore or defer in this course. This is your
	    opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this
	    course.
	    </ul>

	    <p><i>Presentation:</i> Prepare a 5-minute presentation consisting
	    of 3 to 4 slides.</p> 

	    <p>Each group will give a short in-class presentation of
	    their proposal. This is an opportunity for feedback from
	    staff and classmates. Your presentation should cover the
	    same information as the document.</p> 

	    <p>This is an opportunity for feedback, not a formal
	    presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful,
	    and engaged.</p>

	    <p><i>Submission:</i> Uploaded your proposal document by
	    midnight on Tuesday, Sept 26, 2017. Presentations are in class on
	    Wednesday, Sept 27, 2017. Only one person on the project
	    team needs to submit the document and slide deck.</p>

	     <b>Milestone Reports</b><br/>
	  <p>Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory
	    of your project and an opportunity for feedback and
	    guidance from staff and classmates. Convey the state of
	    your project and your plans for the remainder of the
	    semester. Milestone reports consist of a short document and a
	    short in-class presentation.</p>

	    <p><i>Document:</i> Prepare a 1-page document addressing
	    the following points: </p>  
	    <ul>
	      <li>What you have done for this milestone, discussing
	    current progress relative to previously stated plans. 
	      <li>What you will do before your next milestone,
	    including any adaptations based on your status or
	    findings. 
	      <li>Any areas where you could use advice or are
	      blocked.
	      </ul>

	      <p><i>Presentation:</i> Prepare a 10-min presentation
	      consisting of 5 to 6 slides.</p> 

	      <p>Each group will give a short in-class presentation of
	      their proposal. This is an opportunity for feedback from
	      staff and classmates. Your presentation should cover the
	      same information as the document.</p> 

	      <p>This is an opportunity for feedback, not a formal
	      presentation. Please be appropriately candid,
	      thoughtful, and engaged. </p>

	      <p><i>Submission:</i> Upload you milestone documents on Sunday, Nov 5, 2017 and Sunday, Dec 3,
	      2017. The milestone presentations will take place on:
	      Monday, Nov 6 and Wednesday, Nov 8; and Monday, Dec 5
	      and Wednesday, Dec 7.</p>

	      <b>Final Report</b><br/>
	  <p>Prepare a final report that is 4 to 10 pages in length,
	  excluding references.</p> 

	      <p>Your final report should be presented in the same

	  <p>To aid in developing necessary skills, you will complete
	  a statistics lab in R or JMP. The lab will walk you
	  through analyzing an example data set, and you will then
	  analyze two datasets from published research papers. <b>You
	  may work through the lab with a partner, but you must
	  complete the write-up on your own.</b> If you do work with a
	  parnter please include their name in the write-up.</p>

	  <p>You will gain basic familiarity with analyzing experiments using
	  mixed‑model analyses of variance. Consistent with lecture,
	  this assignment is not intended to provide complete
	  knowledge of how to design or analyze experiments, which is
	  far beyond the scope of two lectures or an assignment. This
	  assignment is instead focused on a pragmatic introduction to
	  analyzing experiments based in designs you might later find
	  useful. Please consider this assignment in the context of
	  the material covered in lecture, as not all of it is
	  repeated here.</p> 

	  <p>In addition to the lecture material and the contents of
	  this assignment, you might benefit from working through the
	  first four sections of Jacob Wobbrock’s independent study in
	  <a class="nav"
	  href="http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/ps4hci/">Practical
	  Statistics for Human-Computer Interaction.</a></p>

	  <p>We will hold a discussion session about the independent
	  study and how to conduct it in JMP and R. This independent
	  study provides the background necessary for the lab if you
	  do not already have a strong stats background. The
	  discussion session will take place on Monday, Sept 25th from
	  4:30-6:00pm in the Evans Conference Room, which is the large
	  room on the south end of WEB on the 3rd floor. 
	  </p>

	  <p>Additionally, Sam will hold office hours on Monday, Oct
	  16th to answer questions about the
	  lab. The office hours will be 4:30-6:30pm in the Meldrum
	  conference room (2nd floor of WEB).</p>

<p>Each student has two responsibilities.</p> 

<p>First, organize into groups of 2 to 3 to briefly present one of the
above vision papers. <a class="nav"

        href="https://utah.instructure.com/courses/464132/discussion_topics/2135395
">discussion thread about this on Canvas.</a></p> 




<p>It is critical to remember most people will not have read the paper
you are presenting. It is therefore your responsibility to explain the
vision. One useful way of breaking down and explaining the vision
might be to discuss these four points:</p> 
<ul>
<li>What was the status quo at the time the authors wrote this?
<li>What was the author’s vision of future technologies?
<li>How has this vision played out since this publication?
<li>How might this vision continue to play out in the future?
  </ul>
  
<p><a class="nav"
        href="
        https://utah.instructure.com/courses/464132/assignments/4322199">Submit
        your presentation as 3 to 4 slides</a> in PDF, PPT, PPTX, or
        KEY format 
  on Canvas by 9am. Only one partner should submit.</p>


<p>Second, individually read at least one more of the above vision
    papers.</p>
